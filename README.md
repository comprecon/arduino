- browse examples, and modify one to use your own uniquely transformed input
- make an installation

## Concepts

### Computers and Object-Oriented Programming

We just discovered basically everything a computer/program can do:

- Basic math
- Simple decisions
- Move data from one place to another
- Loop

Itâ€™s the combinations of these things **arranged into a set of instructions** that make a computer program.

#### Development Strategies

The lessons above walked us through an iterative exploratory exercise. "Exploratory programming" is a super fun, creative and effective way to learn how to program, but what about when you have a specific goal in mind?

##### Basic Development Method
- Define the problem that needs to be solved
- Design a solution
- Write a program that implements the solution
- Compile and run that program
- Test and debug

##### Complex Development Method

To tackle a complex problem:

- **break the problem down into a series of one-step problems**
- apply the basic development method (including testing and debugging) to each individual problem
- combine all of your solutions into a master program. Note that this step will also require testing and debugging
